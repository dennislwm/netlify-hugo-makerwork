## An Interview with {{fname}} of {{pname}}

**Hey {{fname}}! Let's start out with your background. 📝**

> I'm a software developer who worked several years as a freelancer and many years as an employee implementing others' ideas. 
> 
> I'm now learning the art of implementing my own ideas and dreams, the art of making projects and working for myself.

**What is the purpose of your blog, and what resources do you use to get your ideas, if any? 🧩**

> I describe things related to my work on my blog Moiva.io and I usually get my ideas from reddit, hacker news, and twitter.

**What is an opinion you have that most people don't agree with? ✒️**

> If people recognized their fear and mistakes and not allow it to creep into their lives, and reevaluated their attitude towards their own mistakes and mistakes of others, we would leave in a different world, live different lives, and relate to the world differently.

**Why was {{pname}} started and is there a roadmap? 🎯**

> I started Moiva because I wanted to fulfil my ambitions, do something useful for many people, make money, as well as work for myself.
>
> The roadmap is to make the project really useful for as many developers as possible, make it popular, bring a broad range of data and statistics in one place and present it in a nice and elegant way.

**What is the most challenging problem that's been solved in {{pname}} so far? 🚧**

> The recent most challenging problem was the transition from an npm package dependant tool to a universal tool that can be used to evaluate any GitHub and Npm projects, with the possibility to add other types of packages like Maven (Java) or PIP (Python).

**What is one feature, which you're most proud of, that differentiates {{pname}} from other products? 🦄**

> I'm most proud of the feature to compare Npm packages and Github repositories side by side with a broad range of statistical and historical data as I've never seen such a tool yet.

**What is one product that you can't live without that you think others should know about? 💡**

> I love VueJS framework.

**If I gave you $1 million to invest in one thing right now, where would you put it? 🚀**

> 

**Thank you {{fname}}.**
