## What I've Been Reading 📖

* ⭐️ [Let's build an actual working Guitar🎸 with JavaScript 💻🤘](https://dev.to/thormeier/let-s-build-an-actual-working-guitar-with-javascript-bfb): *Let's build a guitar! Well, ok, not a physical guitar, but the next best thing: A digital one!*
  
* [Why I Run Django on Kubernetes as a One-Man SaaS](https://anthonynsimon.com/blog/tools-of-the-trade): *When I first published my post on my tech stack as a one-man SaaS I got wildly different reactions. Some told me they loved it and had success with such a stack too, while others politely pointed out it’s too much complexity..*

* [Inside a viral website - Not Fun at Parties](https://notfunatparties.substack.com/p/inside-a-viral-website): *As anyone reading this knows, the Ever Given was stuck in the Suez Canal for just over 6 days. It blocked a route that normally carried ~10% of the world’s trade. More importantly (at least for this post), it also generated more than 10% of the world’s memes. This is an account of running istheshipstillstuck.com.*

* [The Story of a Unicorn Solo Founder Making $500,000 ARR 🚀](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/the-story-of-a-unicorn-solo-founder-making-500-000-arr-4c3070f0f0): *Do what you love, build projects and features people want, and the success will come. I bet you heard that many times. This saying is well known, but I need to point out it takes time to get results.*

* [How I Launched ValueDensity in One Week](https://www.remidiy.com/blog/first-launch): *In my previous article, I've explained why I quit my lucrative data scientist job, 18 months back, to become an indiehacker. In this article I'll share how I launched a product, motivation, methods, mistakes and learnings.*

* [The Part Time Creator Manifesto](https://www.swyx.io/part-time-creator-manifesto): *Something unexpected happened when my side project crossed $100k in sales: I didn't want to quit my job.*

## An Interview with {{fname}} of {{pname}}

**Hey {{fname}}! Let's start out with your background. 📝**

> I'm a Software engineer from Switzerland and I love solving problems, learning new things and sharing my knowledge.
> 
> I originally got into coding while working with the RPGMaker2000 back in high school. The RPGMaker2000 is a tool to create your own 2D games in the style of Final Fantasy 2 and the like. 
> 
> It had a scripting system with if/else blocks, loops, integers and boolean variables etc. That was my first point of contact with code. 
> 
> At some point I wanted my own website to show off my projects, so I learned HTML, CSS and PHP. Along came professional education and some 10 years working in the field.

**What is the purpose of your blog, and what resources do you use to get your ideas, if any? 🧩**

> Sharing my knowledge about all things software development and web. I often write about tools, algorithms and cool stuff I made.
> 
> The internet, mostly search engines. Often I come up with ideas myself, but search engines help a lot when I'm stuck.

**What is an opinion you have that most people don't agree with? ✒️**

> Luck plays a significant role in being successful. You need to meet the right people (you often don't even know these people exist in the first place), publish your stuff everywhere, solve a problem for you have and see if any other people have the same problem and like your solution. 
> 
> Success, as I've learned, is basically trying over and over and, at some point, a happy coincidence helping you gain traction.

**Why was {{pname}} started and is there a roadmap? 🎯**

> I originally created Yummyplan to digitize an analog solution (with paper and sticky notes) we used at home. I wanted this thing to be as useful as possible and to take away a maximum of the boring work, like looking for that one sticky, random meals if we're out of ideas or writing the grocery list. 
> 
> The frontend application is currently published under the MIT license, so it's open source. Since Yummyplan is more of a hobby project, there is a roadmap, but not really a detailed one. 
> 
> Next on my list are further bug fixes and a backend to enable cross-device sharing - I got a lot of feedback that this was a highly desired feature.

**What is the most challenging problem that's been solved in {{pname}} so far? 🚧**

> Definitely the grocery list! There's multiple steps to this behemoth of a feature. 
> 
> First, it needs to collect all the ingredients of all selected menus. Those need to be added up (example: if two menus each use 1 liter of milk, the grocery list should show "2 liters of milk") and are then sorted into categories to make the grocercy trip a lot simpler. 
> 
> Then there's the "tick off" feature, a separate list of items don't need to be bought. The PDF-download was its very own odyssey and I'm still tweaking it.

**What is one feature, which you're most proud of, that differentiates {{pname}} from other products? 🦄**

> The randomize button and the grocery list are among my favorites. They solve problems we had in real life. 
> 
> When we were planing our meals with stickies on a piece of paper, we often ran out of ideas. Also, we often forgot grocery items because we didn't think of them. 
> 
> Those two features alone brought the process of meal planning from 30 minutes down to around 5 minutes and we never forgot to buy anything crucial ever since.

**What is one product that you can't live without that you think others should know about? 💡**

> Vivaldi, a browser by the ex core team of Opera. It lives up to the spirit and is an absolute bliss for power users!

**If I gave you $1 million to invest in one thing right now, where would you put it? 🚀**

> Non-profits that help the less-privileged. Some of them, like cafes that offer safe spaces or sports clubs, really struggle in the current situation and could use some financial support. 
> 
> I'd probably also invest in some startups that work on clean energy or making education more accessibly. ☀️

**Thank you {{fname}}.**
