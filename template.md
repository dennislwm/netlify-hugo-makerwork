## What I've Been Reading 📖

* ⭐️ [Lessons learned after one year indie making: from $125K to $164](https://antonioufano.com/articles/lessons-learned-after-one-year-as-indie-maker): *welve months ago I quit my job as a senior software engineer to become a full-time indie maker. In my previous job I was making around 125K/year and during this year working on my projects I've made $164.*

* [12 Learnings from 12 Months of Working from Home](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/12-learnings-from-months-working-home-sean-brown): *Like many of you, for the last 12 months I’ve been working at home, waiting out the pandemic. During this period of time, YCharts has flourished, growing by ~45%, while also being acquired.*

* [How I almost gave up on Lastform](https://world.hey.com/meydjer/how-i-almost-gave-up-on-lastform-64048d50): *In 2011 I started selling themes for WordPress. It was the first time I managed to make money on the internet. While I was still single, the money was great. But in 2013 I got married, and in 2014 my first daughter was born.*

* [Foam: Six Months Later](https://jevakallio.github.io/notes/foam-six-months-later): *Hello. It’s me, Artist Formerly Known As Lead Maintainer of Foam. You may remember me from such hits as feverishly astroturfing a community around an early-stage open source project and then disappearing into the thin air without any kind of acknowledgement that anything had ever happened.*

* [Things I Made That Sucked](https://www.swiftjectivec.com/things-i-made-that-sucked): *We live in an industry that celebrates and demands success. From posts that proudly show metrics that are up and to the right, to App Store feature tweets - we love to see others hitting on their current ventures. And why not? It’s fun!*

* [I sold Pingr. Lessons learned.](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/i-sold-pingr-lessons-learned-059502d5e6): *That’s it. I sold Pingr, and it doesn’t belong to me from now. After more than a year of working on Pingr, I got an offer from a random person who wanted to acquire it.*

## An Interview with {{fname}} of {{pname}}

**Hey {{fname}}! Let's start out with your background. 📝**

> I'm a full-stack developer with over 10 years of corporate experience working on a wide variety of projects: from small personal websites to full-fledge web applications or complex projects built with microservices and REST APIs. I quit my job a year ago to focus on building my own products.

**What is the purpose of your blog, and what resources do you use to get your ideas, if any? 🧩**

> I write technical articles mostly about Node.js, Vue.js or deployments to different platforms. In addition, I share milestones of my projects and lessons learned.

**What is an opinion you have that most people don't agree with? ✒️**

> 

**Why was {{pname}} started and is there a roadmap? 🎯**

> I created it to scratch my own itch. It's a weekly planner to help people create new habits and achieve life goals. 
> 
> It follows a simple methodology:
> * plan: define tasks related to your goals to work on them during the week
> * execute: work on those tasks
> * analyse: at the end of the week, review your progress and analyse your wins and how can you do better
> * improve: learn from your actions, create better routines based on what works for you
> * repeat
> 
> I've been following this methodoligy for almost four years with great results so I'm sure people will find it helpful.

**What is the most challenging problem that's been solved in {{pname}} so far? 🚧**

> Definitely marketing/sales. As a technical person I focus too much on building new features, improving performance and things like that instead of trying to find new users or get feedback to decide what to work on next.

**What is one feature, which you're most proud of, that differentiates {{pname}} from other products? 🦄**

> The weekly review exercise. It allows users to check their habits for the whole week, review all their tasks and ask them specific questions that helps them analyze their progress.

**What is one product that you can't live without that you think others should know about? 💡**

> MakerLog

**If I gave you $1 million to invest in one thing right now, where would you put it? 🚀**

> I'd pay debts from friends and family, then put most of it on considered safe investments like bonds, dividend stocks or index funds. Oh, and some crypto. 🤑

**Thank you {{fname}}.**
