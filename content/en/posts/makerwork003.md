## Hey Makers! üëã

Welcome to the **Digest 003** of the newsletter. Alex, our featured maker, is creating a valuable platform for the community, sort of like Hacker News, but for podcasts. üèÜ

If you haven't heard of Hacker News it is a social news website focusing on technology and startups. Most of the posts that make it to the front page are community-driven, hence it is important to curate your post such that it's tailored to your audience.

According to RJMetrics the number of submissions made to HN each week has held steady. Participation rate is around 20-30% where users who participate more than 6 months tend to remain active for longer, despite the growth in HN users.

Looking at the best HN posts some subject matters appear to remain constant, e.g. programming, while others fall into and out of current trends. The median score for a HN front page story is 140, however posts that score >4K can be considered as viral.

As Alex said the biggest value of the platform is from the community. But you cannot have a community if you don't have content, and you cannot have content if you don't have a community. ‚≠êÔ∏è

## An Interview with Alex of Podots

**Hey Alex! Let's start out with your background. üìù**

> I am a tech geek from Romania. A programmer by heart currently leading a team of 5 software engineers at Hella. I always have a side project of some sorts, and lately I'm having the online sorts.

**What is the purpose of your blog, and what resources do you use to get your ideas, if any? üß©**

> Here I usually write my weekly thoughts from my journey in this maker's world. It could be anything from personal
experiences to what I actually learned.
>
> I use pexels for pictures, artstationhq for artwork and Canva for creating the blog's cover photo.

**What is an opinion you have that most people don't agree with? ‚úíÔ∏è**

> A couple of months ago, when quarantine started, I got fat and depressed. 
> 
> I totally changed my lifestyle since then, and now, people don't understand the fact that eating within a schedule is actually good for you.
> 
> Most people think I'm starving myself because I'm only eating at certain hours. I don't.

**Why was Podots started and is there a roadmap? üéØ**

> The idea behind this product is straightforward and not even original. It's supposed to be a Hacker News clone, but for podcasts. That's what we've built so far.
> 
> The focus right now is to get more people to use it, since that is the only way we can make the platform valuable.
> 
> This product doesn't have any roadmap. The sole purpose of this product was to test the market if there is actually a need for a podcast exploration platform. 
> 
> I could say that the only real roadmap so far, is that we are planning to have a product hunt launch sometimes this month.

**What is the most challenging problem that's been solved in Podots, so far? üöß**

> Building a platform like this has the following limitation. The biggest value of the platform is from the community. You cannot have a community if you don't have content. You cannot have content if you don't have a community.
> 
> So, as you can see, it's incredibly important to get people to use it. The feedback from the people can then be used to make the product better.
> 
> Until then, we are posting our favorite podcasts on the platform, so people that do come to the platform have some exploring to do.

**What is one product that you can't live without that you think others should know about? üí°**

> Carrd.co

**If I gave you $1 million to invest in one thing right now, where would you put it? üöÄ**

> I would create the biggest network of open-air coworking spaces in Romania. This would leverage both the remote working mega-trend and the people's desire to travel after the pandemic ends. 
> 
> Tourism through coworking spaces is something that I'm really into right now.

**Thank you Alex.**
