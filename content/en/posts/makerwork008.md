## Hey Makers! 👋

Welcome to **Digest 008** of the newsletter. Our featured maker, Pascal, is the author of a web app to create a meal plan for an entire week. 🏆

In a 2018 survey by V. Botev, almost 76% of the subjects stated that they do cook while a small subset of them said they were good at it (26%). Only 13% of the subjects said they know exactly what to cook every time, while 53% had trouble deciding on the meal.

People like cooking at home their own meals however they do have a problem getting from the step where they decide to cook to the step where they actually start cooking. In other words, people had little free time during their busy day for planning their meals.

Fortunately, this problem can be easily solved by using a meal planning app, **Yummyplan**, that can bring down the process of meal planning from 30 minutes to around 5 minutes. ⭐️

## An Interview with Pascal of Yummyplan

**Hey Pascal! Let’s start out with your background. 📝**

> I’m a Software engineer from Switzerland and I love solving problems, learning new things and sharing my knowledge.
>
> I originally got into coding while working with the RPGMaker2000 back in high school. The RPGMaker2000 is a tool to create your own 2D games in the style of Final Fantasy 2 and the like.
>
> It had a scripting system with if/else blocks, loops, integers and boolean variables etc. That was my first point of contact with code.
> 
> At some point I wanted my own website to show off my projects, so I learned HTML, CSS and PHP. Along came professional education and some 10 years working in the field.

**What is the purpose of your blog, and what resources do you use to get your ideas, if any? 🧩**

> Sharing my knowledge about all things software development and web. I often write about tools, algorithms and cool stuff I made.
>
> The internet, mostly search engines. Often I come up with ideas myself, but search engines help a lot when I’m stuck.

**What is an opinion you have that most people don’t agree with? ✒️**

> Luck plays a significant role in being successful. You need to meet the right people (you often don’t even know these people exist in the first place), publish your stuff everywhere, solve a problem for you have and see if any other people have the same problem and like your solution.
>
> Success, as I’ve learned, is basically trying over and over and, at some point, a happy coincidence helping you gain traction.

**Why was Yummyplan started and is there a roadmap? 🎯**

> I originally created Yummyplan to digitize an analog solution (with paper and sticky notes) we used at home. I wanted this thing to be as useful as possible and to take away a maximum of the boring work, like looking for that one sticky, random meals if we’re out of ideas or writing the grocery list.
>
> The frontend application is currently published under the MIT license, so it’s open source. Since Yummyplan is more of a hobby project, there is a roadmap, but not really a detailed one.
>
> Next on my list are further bug fixes and a backend to enable cross-device sharing - I got a lot of feedback that this was a highly desired feature.

**What is the most challenging problem that’s been solved in Yummyplan so far? 🚧**

> Definitely the grocery list! There’s multiple steps to this behemoth of a feature.
>
> First, it needs to collect all the ingredients of all selected menus. Those need to be added up (example: if two menus each use 1 liter of milk, the grocery list should show "2 liters of milk") and are then sorted into categories to make the grocercy trip a lot simpler.
>
> Then there’s the "tick off" feature, a separate list of items don’t need to be bought. The PDF-download was its very own odyssey and I’m still tweaking it.

**What is one feature, which you’re most proud of, that differentiates Yummyplan from other products? 🦄**

> The randomize button and the grocery list are among my favorites. They solve problems we had in real life.
>
> When we were planing our meals with stickies on a piece of paper, we often ran out of ideas. Also, we often forgot grocery items because we didn’t think of them.
>
> Those two features alone brought the process of meal planning from 30 minutes down to around 5 minutes and we never forgot to buy anything crucial ever since.

**What is one product that you can’t live without that you think others should know about? 💡**

> Vivaldi, a browser by the ex core team of Opera. It lives up to the spirit and is an absolute bliss for power users!

**If I gave you $1 million to invest in one thing right now, where would you put it? 🚀**

> Non-profits that help the less-privileged. Some of them, like cafes that offer safe spaces or sports clubs, really struggle in the current situation and could use some financial support.
>
> I’d probably also invest in some startups that work on clean energy or making education more accessibly. ☀️

**Thank you Pascal.**
