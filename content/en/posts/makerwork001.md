## Hey Makers! 👋

Welcome to the **premier digest** of the newsletter. Miguel has the honor of being the first maker to be featured in Makerwork. 🏆

The main problem that beginners face when joining StackOverflow is that there are so many experts in so many activities that it is hard for a beginner to find questions that are good first issues. 

With his passion for AI and programming, Miguel took on this challenge and created Answerable, a recommendation system for discovering Stackoverflow unanswered questions. ⭐️

## An Interview with Miguel of Answerable

**Hey Miguel! Let's start out with your background. 📝**

> I am a Computer Science student in Malaga, Spain. I am interested in the state of education and how knowledge is shared, because I believe that they are a fundamental requirement to improve society. 
> 
> I believe that open source software is a way to foster collaboration between individuals and a learning space as valid as any other.
> 
> Articial intelligence and programming languages are my passion.

**What is the purpose of your blog, and what resources do you use to get your ideas, if any? 🧩**

> General programming and computer science.
> 
> My best sources of ideas are conversations with others and my experiences as student and teacher.

**What is an opinion you have that most people don't agree with? ✒️**

> Computer Science degrees are not meant to teach you software development.

**Why was Answerable started and is there a roadmap? 🎯**

> Answerable is my solution for a problem I faced when I joined StackOverflow. There are so many experts and so many activity that is difficult for beginners to get something done.
> 
> I thought that I would like someone to search through the questions and get me the ones I could answer, so I decided to automate that process. It was also an excuse to learn more about NLP and how recommendation systems work.

**What is the most challenging problem that's been solved in Answerable, so far? 🚧**

> Planning the data retrieval from the StackOverflow web. It is too spread out for fast regular web scraping, so I had to learn to use the API. However, some functions can only be used with authentication, and that's something I still have to learn about.
> 
> Right now, Answerable uses a mix of API calls, RSS requests and an optional download, manually done by the user, to retrieve all the useful data to do the recommendations.

**What is one product that you can't live without that you think others should know about? 💡**

> I can't think of a product, so I'll say Bash aliases. I use them a lot.

**If I gave you $1 million to invest in one thing right now, where would you put it? 🚀**

> Research for forest regeneration and ocean clean up.

**Thank you Miguel.**
