## Hey Makers! üëã

Welcome to **Digest 006** of the newsletter. Our featured maker, Alexey, is the author of a universal tool to evaluate and discover alternatives and compare software projects on **GitHub**. üèÜ

By the end of 2017, over 25 million project repositories were hosted on GitHub and we all know that the number is counting. With so many options out there, it's hard to decide which one is best for you.

Given there are competing tools, it is important not merely to find the appropriate software, but have a metric for judging its usefulness. Indeed, GitHub statistics (counts of stars, watches and forks) were highly correlated with each other, but were distinct from other metrics.

Metrics such as downloads, usage, releases etc may necessarily indicate the software usefulness. Alexey has never seen a tool that could compare GitHub repositories side by side with a broad range of data and statistics.

We suggest that **Moiva** should be used as an objective addition in measuring the utility of software, while Alexey's goal is to make it really useful for as many developers as possible, make it popular, and present it in a nice and elegant way. ‚≠êÔ∏è

## An Interview with Alexey of Moiva

**Hey Alexey! Let‚Äôs start out with your background. üìù**

> I‚Äôm a software developer who worked several years as a freelancer and many years as an employee implementing others‚Äô ideas.
>
> I‚Äôm now learning the art of implementing my own ideas and dreams, the art of making projects and working for myself.

**What is the purpose of your blog, and what resources do you use to get your ideas, if any? üß©**

> I describe things related to my work on my blog Moiva.io. I usually get my ideas from reddit, hacker news, and twitter.

**What is an opinion you have that most people don‚Äôt agree with? ‚úíÔ∏è**

> If people recognized their fear and mistakes and not allow it to creep into their lives, and reevaluated their attitude towards their own mistakes and mistakes of others, we would leave in a different world, live different lives, and relate to the world differently.

**Why was Moiva started and is there a roadmap? üéØ**

> I started Moiva because I wanted to fulfil my ambitions, do something useful for many people, make money, as well as work for myself.
>
> The roadmap is to make the project really useful for as many developers as possible, make it popular, bring a broad range of data and statistics in one place and present it in a nice and elegant way.

**What is the most challenging problem that‚Äôs been solved in Moiva so far? üöß**

> The recent most challenging problem was the transition from an npm package dependant tool to a universal tool that can be used to evaluate any GitHub and Npm projects, with the possibility to add other types of packages like Maven (Java) or PIP (Python).

**What is one feature, which you‚Äôre most proud of, that differentiates Moiva from other products? ü¶Ñ**

> I‚Äôm most proud of the feature to compare Npm packages and Github repositories side by side with a broad range of statistical and historical data as I‚Äôve never seen such a tool yet.

**What is one product that you can‚Äôt live without that you think others should know about? üí°**

> I love VueJS framework.

**Thank you Alexey.**
